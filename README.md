CS1031 Continuous Assessment 3

DESIGN REPORT

I chose white, grey, black, green as the main colours for the website as in my past experiences these more neutral and professional looking colours can lead to the visitors of the website being more trustworthy of the website and therefore more likely to stay on the website for a longer time.

I chose to go for a light blue on the essential experiences page as I think the blue will stand out and draw the website’s visitor’s eyes towards the essential experiences in Watford. In addition to this I put the information in the centre of the page on the visit page as I believe it emphasises the importance of the essential experiences, adding to this I separated the 3 experiences into different boxes as it was an simple way of separating the 3 essential experiences.

I chose to have a horizontal navigation bar at the top of the screen as I believe the horizontal navigation bar to give the website a more polished and professional look; especially when used in tandem with a footer of the same colour as the navigation bar.

I chose to have a sticky navigation bar as I believe it will be beneficial to the visitors of the website, I believe this as the sticky navigation bar will always be located in easy view at the top of the screen. This will lead to visitors of the website not having to search around for the menu, in addition to this if the website was larger the navigation bar would be constantly used and it is useful for it to remain the same position no matter where you are on the website or how far you have scrolled.

When building this website, I faced multiple challenges. One of these challenges was getting the navigation bar to be sticky and stay at the top of the screen when you scrolled down on the website, I overcame this by looking up multiple videos online and using W3 Schools and then I used trial and error until I manged to get it successfully working.
